git init 

git add .

git commit -m "your message"

if you made any wrong after commit there are two solution to resolve this problem
   
    -->git commit --hard (id) :this delete all the modication
    -->git commit --soft (id) :return ,but not delete the modication

after that :

git commit --ammend --no-edit :do not create a new commit ,just add to the preveous commit

git show (id:this id of the commit)


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Branch :

git branch :see all the branch disponible

create new branch and switch to the new branch :

git checkout -b name_branch


for exemple when you create a new branch based to the branch master .

when you are satistifed and want to megere it with branch master

you need to do :

-git add .
-git commit -m 'your message'

after that you need to switch to the master

-git checkout master
-git merge your_branch


--->delete branch there are two way

when you want to delete a branch that you merge to other branch you use 
-git branch -d branch_you_want_to_delete

when you want to delete a branch but never used  
-git branch -D branch_you_want_to_delete

okkk
